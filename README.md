# Test On Save

Tired of switching to the test explorer to run test while working TDD style?
This extension will automatically run them for you when you save a file!

## Features

* Language independent - command to run tests can be set through ``settings.json``
* Can be enabled/disabled through ``settings.json`` or by clicking the status bar icon
* Runs discretely in the background - no annoying popups, only red or green status bar icon displaying last test result
